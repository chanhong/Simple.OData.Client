# Simple.OData.Client - The Best OData Client for .NET
[Releases](https://github.com/simple-odata-client/Simple.OData.Client/releases)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Documentation](https://github.com/simple-odata-client/Simple.OData.Client/wiki)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[OData v4.01 Documentation](https://www.odata.org/documentation/)

## Simple.OData.Client (Complete Package)

This package contains the complete Simple.OData.Client solution, encompassing all versions of the OData specification.

Most modern OData APIs will want to use the [Simple.OData.V4.Client package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Simple.OData.V4.Client), which has a lighter memory footprint. If you only need to support OData v3 and earlier, you can use the [Simple.OData.V3.Client package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Simple.OData.V3.Client).

## Supported Platforms
This library supports all of the .NET runtimes Microsoft supports as of March 2024. This includes:
- .NET 8.0
- .NET 7.0
- .NET Standard 2.0 (for .NET Framework 4.6.1 and later => .NET Core)
